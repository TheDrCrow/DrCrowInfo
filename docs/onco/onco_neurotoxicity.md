## Neurotoxicity

**Lots of different pathways as outlined in this handy diagram**

> Note a lot of these are quite modern. 

### List of Neuro Disorders 

| Name    | Path     | Radiology     | Notes     |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy**<br>PRES (1st=1996)  | **Causes:**<br>Chemo/Immuno esp Tac + VEGF<br>HT / Renal Dysfunction / Pre-eclampsia<br>Sepsis<br>Transplantation (solid & BMT)<br>Haem Malignancy<br>**Path:** Complex. Variation in BP overrides the cerebral autoregulation boundaries. Also endothelial dysfunction with CK release.<br>Leads to extravasation and loss of BBB failures and on histo ranges from mild WM oedema to fibrinoid vascular necrosis with fibrin extravasation.<br>'Posterior' is due to relative lack of sympathetic innervation. | **MRI**: Mostly subcortical WM and vasogenic oedema.<br>Parieto-occipital 99%<br>Posterior Frontal 80%<br>Temporal 70%<br>Thalamic 30%<br>Cerebellum 35%<br>Brainstem 20%<br>Basal Ganglia 10%<br>[Unilateral in 2%]<br>**ADC** 0/-. Low in 20% and is assoc with poor outcome.<br>Haem 20% have macro but SWI =60%. Can be parenchymal or SAH<br>Mostly reversible. | **CF:** Quite extensive<br>Encephalopathy 55%<br>Seizures 70%<br>Headache 50%<br>Visual Disturbance 33%<br>Focal Neuro 10-15%<br>Status 10%<br>**Rx:** Supportive. Control of HT. Review Medication.  |
| **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy**<br>PML | **Path:** John Cunningham virus (JCV) demyelinating disorder<br>**Aetiology:** HIV, Immume suppression and therapies. <br> Esp BMT, CLL, NHL and anti-CD20 (Ritux)<br>**CF:** Progressive loss of mental functions.<br>Confusion -> Focal neuro deficits, loss of motor, visual, speech and ataxia.<br> Weeks -> Months. | **Rad:** T2/FLAIR ++ in subcortical white matter involving ***u-fibres***. Anywhere and usually multifocal esp frontal and par-occ. Then moves deeper into centrum semiovale. Over time becomes large confluent lesions.<br>Oedema 0 / Mass effect 0 <br>Gd 0/+ (27%) - faint/patchy<br> ADC -/-- Edge of tumour | **Dx:** CSF for JC virus or Brain bx.<br> **Rx:** Difficult. Reverse immunosuppression. Some antivirals and immune stimulants.
