## Nodules 
Are the most common general pattern of malignant infiltration into the chest.  
Several specific patterns  

### Miliary Nodules 
 - Thyroid 
 - RCC 
 - Melanoma  

### Ground Glass Nodule 
 - Choriocarcinoma
 - Melanoma 
 - RCC 
 - Angiosarcoma 
 - HL / NHL  

 > Can be due to:
>> Focal interstitial infiltration.   
 > Partial airspace filling by tumour.   
 > Haemorrhage which mostly produces a halo.   
 > Mucin-producing tumours (ie CRC). These tend to coalesce to produce consolidation.  
 > Also can get diffuse multifocal lung adenoca (aka BACC) which does lepidic growth around alveolar walls and partial filling of airspaces.   

### Calcified Nodules 
 - Osteo or chondrosarcoma.  
 - Mucinous adenoCa. 
 - Also Pap Thyroid Ca, Synovial cell sarcoma. 
 - And treated metastases.
