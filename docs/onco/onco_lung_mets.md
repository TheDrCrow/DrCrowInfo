## Nodules 
Are the most common general pattern of malignant infiltration into the chest.  
Several specific patterns  

### Miliary Nodules 
 - Thyroid 
 - RCC 
 - Melanoma  

### Ground Glass Nodule 
 - Choriocarcinoma
 - Melanoma 
 - RCC 
 - Angiosarcoma 
 - HL / NHL  

 > Can be due to:
>> Focal interstitial infiltration.   
 > Partial airspace filling by tumour.   
 > Haemorrhage which mostly produces a halo.   
 > Mucin-producing tumours (ie CRC). These tend to coalesce to produce consolidation.  
 > Also can get diffuse multifocal lung adenoca (aka BACC) which does lepidic growth around alveolar walls and partial filling of airspaces.   

### Calcified Nodules 
 - Osteo or chondrosarcoma.  
 - Mucinous adenoCa. 
 - Also Pap Thyroid Ca, Synovial cell sarcoma. 
 - And treated metastases. 

 > DD: Granuloma. Amyloid. Hamartoma. 

### Nodules with Branching Morphology. 

#### Airways 
 - Breast 
 - Kidney
 - Colon 
 - Lymphoma
 - Melanoma  

> Can be:  
>> i. Trachea to Segmental Airway.  
    "Arborizing opacity" paralleling the vessels  
    +/- Collapse distally.  

>> ii. Respiratory to Terminal Bronchiole.  
    Centrilobular opacity.    
    Tree-in-bud.    

#### Vessels  
 - Soft tissue Sarcoma 
 - RCC 
 - HCC 
 - Melanoma  

> Tumour in the medium to small arteries    
>> Producing branching lobular enlargement which can be smooth or beaded.  
>> Can lead to peripheral infarction.  

Can rarely be Tumour Venous Thrombosis   
from either invasion of the LA or of invasion of the venous system.   
Lead to Dilated PV with/without filling defects in the LA or venous system.  
Mostly due to Squamous Cell Carcinoma or Sarcoma.   

### Cystic or Cavitating Nodules
 - Squamous Cell Carcinoma (of cervix, H+N)
 - Colorectal Carcinoma  
 - Sarcoma  
 - Urothelial Carcinoma  
 - Lymphoma   
*But also consider the non-neoplastics*
 - GPA ( Wegeners ) 
 - Eosinophilic GPA ( Churg-Strauss )
 - Rh A 
 - Amyloidosis  
 - LCH ( 3-4 mm with thin walls )
 - INFECTION = Fungi, mycobacteria, septic emboli 
 - OTHER = Tracheobronchial papillomatosis.   

 > Cavitation and decreasing size suggests treatment response. 

---- 

### Reticular Pattern Disease.  

Infiltration of tumour into interstitial components which are:  
   
1. Perihilar axial interstitium 
2. Centrilobular interstitium 
3. Subpleural interstitium 
4. Interlobular septa  

> Lymphangititis should leave the rest of the lung normal unlike ILD.  

Lymphatic spread can be: 

1. via Pulmonary Arterial Mets:  
    1. Breast 
    2. GIT 
    3. Melanoma
2. via Direct Extension from hilar lymphadenopathy:  
    1. HD 
    2. NHL.
