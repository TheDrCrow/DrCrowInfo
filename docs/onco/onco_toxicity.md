### List of Neuro Disorders 

| Name    | Path     | Radiology     | Notes     |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy**<br>PRES (1st=1996)  | **Causes:**<br>Chemo/Immuno esp Tac + VEGF<br>HT / Renal Dysfunction / Pre-eclampsia<br>Sepsis<br>Transplantation (solid & BMT)<br>Haem Malignancy<br>**Path:** Complex. Variation in BP overrides the cerebral autoregulation boundaries. Also endothelial dysfunction with CK release.<br>Leads to extravasation and loss of BBB failures and on histo ranges from mild WM oedema to fibrinoid vascular necrosis with fibrin extravasation.<br>'Posterior' is due to relative lack of sympathetic innervation. | **MRI**: Mostly subcortical WM and vasogenic oedema.<br>Parieto-occipital 99%<br>Posterior Frontal 80%<br>Temporal 70%<br>Thalamic 30%<br>Cerebellum 35%<br>Brainstem 20%<br>Basal Ganglia 10%<br>[Unilateral in 2%]<br>**ADC** 0/-. Low in 20% and is assoc with poor outcome.<br>Haem 20% have macro but SWI =60%. Can be parenchymal or SAH<br>Mostly reversible. | **CF:** Quite extensive<br>Encephalopathy 55%<br>Seizures 70%<br>Headache 50%<br>Visual Disturbance 33%<br>Focal Neuro 10-15%<br>Status 10%<br>**Rx:** Supportive. Control of HT. Review Medication.  |
| **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy**<br>PML | **Path:** John Cunningham virus (JCV) demyelinating disorder<br>**Aetiology:** HIV, Immume suppression and therapies. <br> Esp BMT, CLL, NHL and anti-CD20 (Ritux)<br>**CF:** Progressive loss of mental functions.<br>Confusion -> Focal neuro deficits, loss of motor, visual, speech and ataxia.<br> Weeks -> Months. | **Rad:** T2/FLAIR ++ in subcortical white matter involving ***u-fibres***. Anywhere and usually multifocal esp frontal and par-occ. Then moves deeper into centrum semiovale. Over time becomes large confluent lesions.<br>Oedema 0 / Mass effect 0 <br>Gd 0/+ (27%) - faint/patchy<br> ADC -/-- Edge of tumour | **Dx:** CSF for JC virus or Brain bx.<br> **Rx:** Difficult. Reverse immunosuppression. Some antivirals and immune stimulants. 
| **Hypophysitis** | **Causes:** Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) esp. anti-CTLA4 = IPI in ~10% whilst anti-PD1 <1%.<br> Also produces other CNS syndromes ie encephalitis (non-spec CF & MRI), MS etc. | **Rad:** Inc Size of pit gland and stalk.<br> No involvement of optic chiasm.<br>Gd ++<br> | **CF:** 6-12/52 post start<br> Headaches, fatigue, dizziness, memory impairment.<br> Ant Pit dysfunction (dec ACTH, TSH). But post pit is preserved.<br> qv Mets when DI is common.<br> **Rx:** Steroids and pit replacement.  | 
| **Cerebrovascular Disease**<br> CVD| **Path:** Increased risk due to hypercoagulability.<br> L-asparaginase => High risk of CVD and CST.<br> VEGF inhib (BEVA) => Ischaemic stroke, TIA, Haem stroke.<br> Small molecular kinase inhibitors lead to similar.<br>BRAF kinase inhib (VEN/DABRA) in melanoma and are radiation sensitisors => Cerebral oedema and Haem. | | | 
| **Toxic Leukoencephalopathy**<br> aka MTX-induced Leukoencephalopathy | **Causes:** Many but especially methtrexate.<br> MTX-induced can be *acute* or *late*. And *transient* vs *permanent* <br>Seen in 4% of paed ALL.<br>Both iv and i.t. implicated.<br> Other causes include 5-FU => 'Stroke-like' syndrome. | **Rad:** Variable and depends on agent and state.<br> MTX: T2++ in DWM.<br> 5-FU: T2++/ADC-- in well-defined lesions in subcortical WM, corticospinal tracts & CC. But not in vascular territories<br>Generally reversible post withdrawal so may not be a metabolic disorder.<br> *Delayed Toxic Leukoencephalopathy*: Diffuse hemispheric T2++/ADC0 and often asymptomatic | In MTX 20% of treated have mild changes on MRI but are symptomatic. | 
| **Toxic Myelopathy** | **Causes:** Intrathecal MTX | **Rads:** T2++ in dorsal columns | **CF:** Mimics SACD<br> Ascending motor weakness<br> Sensory loss<br>Urinary and bowel incontinence<br> N B12 levels | 
| **Radiation** | **Path:**<br> Vascular abnormalities. Demyelination. WM necrosis. | 1) Acute = Days to Weeks. Now rare. Headaches and drowsiness. Steroid responsive.<br> 2) Early Delayed = 1 to 6 months. Transient demyelination. Somnolence. Rads: Periventricular WM changes.<br> 3) Late Delayed = >6/12. Radiation necrosis. Rads: Focal or multifocal WM oedema +/- Gd +/0 in RT bed. OR, white matter lesions with vascular abn, demyelination and then WM necrosis developing from PV WM into DWM and subcortical WM.<br>No mass effect / ADC. Generally slowly progressive. | **CF:** Progressive memory, attention, exec fn deficits.<br> From 4/12 on<br> ~70% of LT RT survivors.<br>MRI can be normal on structural imaging and only seen on DTI. | 
| **Sterotactic Radiosurgery**<br>SR. Includes gamma knife or cyber knife | **Path:** Radiation necrosis peaking at 9-12 months post procedure. | **Rads:** Vasogenic oedema with mass effect and possible enhancement<br>DD = Recurrence.  | **CF:** No one quite sure about the best approach to take here. ??perfusion imaging ?? PET. Or just follow up or biopsy. | 
| **Haemorrhagic Radiation Effects** | **Path:** Microvascular damage<br>Also cavernomas | **Rad:** SWI lots of dots | |
| **Secondary Tumour** | Especially in childhood RT<br>7-10x Risk. 1-25% risk.| | Generally from 5yrs post for Gliomas and from 15ys for meningiomas |

## Chest Toxicities 

### Radiation

| Name    | Path    | Radiology    | Notes    |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Radiation Pneumonitis** | **Histo:** No pathognomic features and is essentially similar to DAD. ~ organising alveolar disease wit fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis.  | **Rad:** Usually sharply marginated ground glass to consolidation then fibrosis.<br>***CT:*** 4 patterns generally following increasing dose: Homogeneous GG -> Patchy Consolidation -> Discrete consolidation -> Solid consolidation with TB. GG can be seen by 2-3 weeks on CT.| **CF:** Most asymptomatic (20% of total only have signs on XR) but cough, fever and SoB. Presents at 6-8 weeks post RT and peaks at 3 - 4/12.  |
| **Radiation Fibrosis** | Path: Seen in essentially all therapeutic dose patients<br>Becomes clear from 3/12 and increases to 12/12 | **Rad:** Defined by the bounds of the field (mostly)<br>Strand-like with TB and volume loss.<br>+/- Mild pleural thickening.<br>***Conformal 3D RT:***Produces 1 of 3 patterns<br>1. Mass-like appearances surrounding tumour.<br>2.Modified Conventional post RT changes but sometimes with peripheral sparing.<br>3.Scar-like <= 1cm fibrosis as a thin-band. | **Other:** Can also see<br>- Hyperlucency of aerated lung<br>- Spontaneous pneumothorax<br>- Calcification in LN and thymic cysts | 
| **Radiation & Chemo Combination**  | ***Radiation Sensitisers:*** Produce earlier and generally worse disease and include Actinomycin D, Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Cyclophosphamide, MitoC and Vincristine.<br>***Parenchymal Agents*** Some chemo agents that produce lung disease have the disease worsened by RT. Includes Bleomycin, Busulphan and MTX  | **Rad:** Variable but includes alveolar infiltrates and reticulonodular patterns often leading to fibrosis. | |
