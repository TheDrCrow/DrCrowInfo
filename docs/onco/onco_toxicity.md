# Toxicity of Cancer Therapeutics 

## Terminology

#### Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 

- Grade 1 (mild): Asymptomatic or minimal. No intervention needed.  
- Grade 2 (moderate): Minimal, local or non-invasive intervention needed. Limiting ADLs   
- Grade 3 (severe): Hospitalisation or prolongation. Disabling, limiting self-care.  
- Grade 4 (life-threatening): Urgent intervention needed. 
- Grade 5: (fatal): RIP.

## Chest Toxicities 

### Radiation

| Name    | Path    | Radiology    | Notes    |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| **Radiation Pneumonitis** | **Histo:** No pathognomic features and is essentially similar to DAD. ~ organising alveolar disease wit fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis.  | **Rad:** Usually sharply marginated ground glass to consolidation then fibrosis.<br>***CT:*** 4 patterns generally following increasing dose: Homogeneous GG -> Patchy Consolidation -> Discrete consolidation -> Solid consolidation with TB. GG can be seen by 2-3 weeks on CT.| **CF:** Most asymptomatic (20% of total only have signs on XR) but cough, fever and SoB. Presents at 6-8 weeks post RT and peaks at 3 - 4/12.  |
| **Radiation Fibrosis** | Path: Seen in essentially all therapeutic dose patients<br>Becomes clear from 3/12 and increases to 12/12 | **Rad:** Defined by the bounds of the field (mostly)<br>Strand-like with TB and volume loss.<br>+/- Mild pleural thickening.<br>***Conformal 3D RT:***Produces 1 of 3 patterns<br>1. Mass-like appearances surrounding tumour.<br>2.Modified Conventional post RT changes but sometimes with peripheral sparing.<br>3.Scar-like <= 1cm fibrosis as a thin-band. | **Other:** Can also see<br>- Hyperlucency of aerated lung<br>- Spontaneous pneumothorax<br>- Calcification in LN and thymic cysts | 
| **Radiation & Chemo Combination**  | ***Radiation Sensitisers:*** Produce earlier and generally worse disease and include Actinomycin D, Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Cyclophosphamide, MitoC and Vincristine.<br>***Parenchymal Agents*** Some chemo agents that produce lung disease have the disease worsened by RT. Includes Bleomycin, Busulphan and MTX  | **Rad:** Variable but includes alveolar infiltrates and reticulonodular patterns often leading to fibrosis. | | 

#### Heart 
Leads to small and medium vessel damage and thrombosis leading to parenchymal Fibrosis. 

Can lead to: 

- Acute and chronic pericarditis.  
- CAD (RIP inc'd by 10 to 15yrs)
- Valvular dysfunction (*esp MVR and AVR*).
- Cardiomyopathy (Dilated, Restrictive, Hypertrophic)
- Conduction abnormalities (eg QT prolongation)

#### Oesophagus 
More of a problem with intense dose regimes and with other agents.   

Can lead to ***Radiation oesophagitis*** but CF of this and other effects include: 

- Dysmotility (most common)
- Mucosal oedema 
- Ulceration & Fistula 
- Stricture   

Also Squamous cell Ca oesophagus. Mean = 14ys post.

#### Bone and Soft tissue Sarcoma. 

<= 1 in 1000 px living 5ys post RT.   
Mean = 10-15ys but range = 2 to 55 ys post. 
Bone = Osteosarcomas. Soft = Undifferentiated plexiform sarcoma. 

Also post RT Osteochondromas  
- Common ~ 10% of kids. 

### Chemotherapy Effect in Chest  

#### Drug Induced Pneumonitis   

a) **Immune Checkpoints Inhibitors** 
Pneumonitis in 5%   
CT = Variable. Ranging from AIP/ARDS (severe end) to COP / Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis / NSIP (milder end).   
CF = Severe end up in ITU whilst mild = Steroids. 

b) **Molecular Targets**  
eg mTOR inhib, eGFR inhib, ALK inhib, anti-CD20.  
In up to 25% but only 2% severe.   
CT = Again range from AIP/ARDS(Severe) -> Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis.   

c) **Pleural Effusion**  
Dosatinib.   

d) **Others:** 
Rarer.  
Pulmonary oedema, PTX (mostly in Rx'd sarcoma), Pulmonary haem (beva), Sarcoid-like granulomatosis seen with IPI/NIVO  

#### Drug Induced Cardiotoxicity 
Both old and new agents.  
Wide range of abnormalities including LV dysfunction, dilated CMP, HT, CAD, myocarditis, arrhythmia, pericarditis, effusion. 

a) **Anthracyclines** = Prototypical  
3-5% at 400mg/m^2 but 30% at 700mg/m^2 cumulative.  
=> Myocyte damage via several pathways.   

b) **Other Chemo**   
include Cap, 5-FU, Cyclophosphamide, Taxanes.  

c) **Other newer agents**   
include Tras, Pert, Beva, Sunit Soraf, Imi. 


Assessment often complicated and multimodal including MR and 3D Echo.

## Abdominopelvic Toxicities 

### **HPB**

    - or Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome.   
2. Pseudocirrhosis = esp breast ca mets.    
    - can get caudate enlargement, ascites and splenomegaly.

2. **Spleen** = v radiosensitive. 
    - 4-8 Gy => destruction of all lymphoid tissue.   
3. **Pancreas**   
    - Chronic pancreatitic like changes. 
    - Acinar epithelium more sensitive than the islet cells.   

### **GI** 

#### Chemotoxicities 

1. **SB wall thickening** = common and usually no other rad features.  
2. **Enteritis**

    - Early = Oedema. Occ obn which resolves conservatively.  
    - Late = Chronic AP, D, occ malabsorption, occ intermittent SBO   

3. **Colon & Rectum**

### **GU**

#### Chemotoxicities 

1. **Kidneys**   
    - Acute AKI or chronic nephrotoxicity which leads to atrophy and loss of cortex.   

2. **Bladder**

90% of pelvic RT patients get chronic CIBH with 50% reporting a significant dec in QoL.   

Timing:  

- Acute PRD : Immediate to 3/12.   
    - D, tenesmus, rectal bleeding  

- Chronic PRD : 6/12 to 3ys Progressive but can be 30ys later.   
    - Due to progressive ischaemia and fibrosis.  

- Delayed / Latent PRD : Starts yrs to decades later.   
    - Path Oxidative stress to nuclear DNA  

#### Second malignancy  

For Prostate RT: 1 in 70 >10yr survivors get a second tumour mostly rectal or bladder.   

For kids, 10% at 20ys. ~> lymphoma, sarcoma or leukaemia.
