## Staging 

### Lugano Classification 

| Stage   | Description    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| LIMITED Stage  |    |
| I   | Involvement of single lymphatic site (eg nodal region, spleen, Waldeyers ring)   |
| IE   | Single Extralymphatic site.<br>No nodes.   |
| II   | Two or more nodal regions on the same side of the diaphragm.  |
| IIE  | Contiguous extralymphatic extension from a nodal site +/- involvement of other nodal regions on the same side of the diaphragm.  |
| II Bulky   | Can be limited or advanced stage depending on histo and prognostic factors.<br>Maximum diameter of largest mass should be measured.<br>HL: Mass >10cm or >1/3 thoracic diameter on CT.<br>F-NHL: Mass >6cm.<br>DLBCL: Mass >10cm |
| ADVANCED |    |
| III   | Nodal regions on both sides of diaphragm OR<br>Nodes above the diaphragm and splenic involvement. |
| IV   | Diffuse / disseminated involvement >1 extralymphatic organ +/- nodal involvement OR<br>Non-contiguous extra-nodal involvement with stage II nodal disease OR<br>Any extralymphatic organ involvement in stage III disease. NB Includes any involvement of CSF, bone marrow, liver or lungs except by direct extension in stage IIE |  

> Waldeyers ring, thymus and spleen are considered nodal or lymphatic site.   
> Any liver involvement by contiguous or non-contiguous spread should be regarded as Stage IV disease.   
> 'B' classification is for HL only.

### St Jude Staging Classification for Paediatric NHL   

| Stage   | Classification    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| I | Single tumour (extranodal) or<br>Single nodal area excluding mediastinum or abdomen. |
| II | Single tumour (extranodal) with regional nodal involvement OR<br>Two or more nodal areas on the same side of the diaphragm OR<br>Two single (extranodal) tumours +/- regional nodal involvement on the same side of the diaphragm OR<br>A primary GI tract tumour (usu ileocaecal) +/- associated mesenteric nodal involvement. |
| III | Two single tumours (extranodal) on opposite sides of the diaphragm OR<br>Two or more nodal areas above and below the diaphragm.OR<br>All primary intrathoracic tumours (including pleural) OR<br>All extensive primary intra-abdominal disease.OR<br>All paraspinal or epidural tumours regardless of other tumour sites. |
| IV | Any of the above with initial CNS +/- bone marrow involvement |  

## Prognostication. 
Adverse prognostic factors  

#### HL 

##### Early  
 - B symptoms 
 - Bulky mediastinal disease 
 - Mass >10cm on CT  
 - ESR >= 50
 - \> 3 or 4 nodal areas 
 - Extranodal lesions 
 - Age > 50

##### Advanced = International Prognostic Score (IPS) 
 - Serum albumin <4g/dl  
 - Hb <10.5g/dl 
 - Male sex  
 - Age \>= 45y 
 - Stage IV disease  
 - WCC \>= 15000 or <= 600/mm^2

#### DLBCL = International Prognostic Index (IPI)  
 - ECOG performance status >= 2 
 - Age >60  
 - Raised LDH  
 - Extranodal sites >= 2  
 - Stage III or IV  

> Revised - IPI (R-IPI) = Same criteria but better data for the Rituximab era.  
> NCCN-IPI = Stratifies Age & LDH.  
> Also Cell of Origin = Germinal centre type or Activated B-cell type.  

#### F-NHL = FL International Prognostic Index (FLIPI)-1  
 - \>= 3 nodal groups  
 - Raised LDH  
 - Age >60  
 - Stage III/IV  
 - Hb < 12g/dl 

##### or FLIPI-2  
 - Longest diameter of single site >6cm  
 - Raised beta-2-microglobulin.  
 - Bone Marrow involvement 
 - Hb <12g/dl
