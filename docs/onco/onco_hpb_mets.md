[^Sahdev]: Sahdev A and Vinnicombe S. Husband & Resnek Imaging in Oncology. CRC Press 2020. 

## Differential Diagnosis  

- Colon  
- Breast 
- Lung 
- Pancreas 
- Stomach   
> Melanin = Melanoma ( high T1 )
> Mucin = Mucinous pancreas / colon / ovaries 
> Haemorrhage = rare.

Mets are all BS mostly arterial whilst parenchyma is 25% .  

### Hypervascular  

- NET ( carcinoid, insulinoma, phaeo )
- Thyroid 
- Renal (RCC) 
- Breast ( small and odd )
- Melanoma 
- Sarcoma  

### Hypovascular  
- Adenocarcinoma ( GI, pancreas and lungs )
- Breast Ca  
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( ENT, Lung, Anus )
- Lymphoma  

### Technique 
Suggest do initial staging of arterial and portal. 
- Detect arterial mets   
- Differential benign lesions better.  

Then suggest single phase if ok. 

Primovist can have uptake into mets due to persistent vascular signal but also uptake into fibrous scars.

### Treatment and Treatment Effects 

#### Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) 

Can be done for mets generally <3cm, 1-3 in number (<5), NOT next to major bile ducts. 

#### Post - RFA 

1. Non-enhancing area = Coagulation Necrosis 
    - should have 0.5cm margin.
    - can have rim enhancement due to phys reaction. 
    - this phase is over by approx 1 month. 
2. Usually this lesion will shrink over time.  
3. Concerning features for recurrence 
    - Ablation is smaller than initial lesion.
    - Non rim-like enhancement. 
    - Increasing size of enhancement.
    - New enhancement after 1 month.

> Persistence of lesion and round shape and low attenuation suggests biloma. 

#### Tumour Resection 

 - Can get fluid collection +/- gas in bile ducts etc.
 - Expect hypertrophy of the normal structures
 - Tumour recurrence = Solid enhancing mass. 

### Differential Diagnosis 

#### FNH  
- Central scar = enhances in equilibrium phase (both CT & MR) and ^^T2.  
    - but can be seen in breast Ca Mets.
- Primovist = Signal in delayed phase (mets are low signal)

#### Haemangioma 
- Higher T2 and usually centripetal enhancement. 
- Small ones are tricky and tend to be hypervascular. 
- Primovist is not helpful as get 'pseudo-washout'.

## Splenic Mets 

Uncommon (1-3% in PMs). Thought to be due to lack of afferent lymph vessels.  
Very rare as the only site of metastatic disease.   

#### Usual splenic diseases 
- NHL/HD. 
- Infection. 
- Storage Disorders. 
- Congestion. 
- Extramedullary haematopoiesis.  

#### Splenic Mets 
- Melanoma
- Breast
- Lung 
- Colorectal  
- Ovary 
- Stomach  

#### Splenic Implants  
- Usually Peritoneal carcinomatosis 
    - Ovary
    - Pancreas 
    - Gastric 
    - Colorectal  

#### Splenic lesion Differential   
- Haemangioma  
- Lymphangioma  
- Hamartoma  
- Littoral Cell Angioma  
- Cysts (False, Epidermoid, Parasitic)
