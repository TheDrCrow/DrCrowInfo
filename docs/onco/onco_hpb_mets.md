# Liver Mets  [^Sahdev]

[^Sahdev]: Sahdev A and Vinnicombe S. Husband & Resnek Imaging in Oncology. CRC Press 2020. 

## Differential Diagnosis  

- Colon  
- Breast 
- Lung 
- Pancreas 
- Stomach   
> Melanin = Melanoma ( high T1 )
> Mucin = Mucinous pancreas / colon / ovaries 
> Haemorrhage = rare.

Mets are all BS mostly arterial whilst parenchyma is 25% .  

### Hypervascular  

- NET ( carcinoid, insulinoma, phaeo )
- Thyroid 
- Renal (RCC) 
- Breast ( small and odd )
- Melanoma 
- Sarcoma  

### Hypovascular  
- Adenocarcinoma ( GI, pancreas and lungs )
- Breast Ca  
- Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( ENT, Lung, Anus )
- Lymphoma  

### Technique 
Suggest do initial staging of arterial and portal. 
- Detect arterial mets   
- Differential benign lesions better.  

Then suggest single phase if ok. 

Primovist can have uptake into mets due to persistent vascular signal but also uptake into fibrous scars.

### Treatment and Treatment Effects 

#### Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) 

Can be done for mets generally <3cm, 1-3 in number (<5), NOT next to major bile ducts. 

#### Post - RFA 

1. Non-enhancing area = Coagulation Necrosis 
    - should have 0.5cm margin.
    - can have rim enhancement due to phys reaction. 
    - this phase is over by approx 1 month. 
2. Usually this lesion will shrink over time.  
3. Concerning features for recurrence 
    - Ablation is smaller than initial lesion.
    - Non rim-like enhancement. 
    - Increasing size of enhancement.
    - New enhancement after 1 month.

> Persistence of lesion and round shape and low attenuation suggests biloma. 

#### Tumour Resection 

 - Can get fluid collection +/- gas in bile ducts etc.
 - Expect hypertrophy of the normal structures
 - Tumour recurrence = Solid enhancing mass. 

### Differential Diagnosis 

#### FNH  
- Central scar = enhances in equilibrium phase (both CT & MR) and ^^T2.  
    - but can be seen in breast Ca Mets.
- Primovist = Signal in delayed phase (mets are low signal)

#### Haemangioma 
- Higher T2 and usually centripetal enhancement. 
- Small ones are tricky and tend to be hypervascular. 
- Primovist is not helpful as get 'pseudo-washout'.

## Splenic Mets 

Uncommon (1-3% in PMs). Thought to be due to lack of afferent lymph vessels.  
Very rare as the only site of metastatic disease.   

#### Usual splenic diseases 
- NHL/HD. 
- Infection. 
- Storage Disorders. 
- Congestion. 
- Extramedullary haematopoiesis.  

#### Splenic Mets 
- Melanoma
- Breast
- Lung 
- Colorectal  
- Ovary 
- Stomach  

#### Splenic Implants  
- Usually Peritoneal carcinomatosis 
    - Ovary
    - Pancreas 
    - Gastric 
    - Colorectal  

#### Splenic lesion Differential   
- Haemangioma  
- Lymphangioma  
- Hamartoma  
- Littoral Cell Angioma  
- Cysts (False, Epidermoid, Parasitic)

## Adrenal Mets & Other Stuff. 

4th most common but freq asymptomatic esp in elderly.  
Hypoadrenalism is rare and usually only with bilateral and large in young people.   
#### Causes  
Breast (30-40% will get them)  
Lung (30-40% will get them)  
Melanoma (50%)
GI (10%)  
Renal (10%) 

90% are carcinomas (Rest are melanomas, NHL, sarcomas)  

#### Differentials 
1. Adenoma / Fat-poor adenoma 
    - 10% of normal on CT. 0.2% at 20yo, 7% at 70yo. 
    - ~ Obesity, DM, Age, Female
2. Adrenal Cyst 
    - F>M 
    - Can look a bit confusing. 
3. Primary Adrenal Carcinoma 
    - Rare & very malignant. 
    - \>6cm, Hetero, Ca2+, necrotic. 
4. Myelolipoma  
    - Fat and haematopoietic tissue. 
    - Fat should be the same attenuation as the subcutaneous fat. 

#### Radiological Features 

Normal limbs <5mm   
Mets = Homogeneous if <3cm, but heterogeneous >3cm.  
Hypo T1 (vs Liver) and Hyper T2 (can be +++ and thus look like phaeo)

**Size**  
\>3cm = 90-95% are malignant.  
\<3cm = 85% are benign.  

**Bilateral** 
Not confirmatory as bilateral adenomas are not uncommon.  
And think of phaeo and TB as alternatives. 

**CT Criteria**  
Based on 2 concepts:   
1) FAT CONTAINING = ADENOMA  
*though rare mets in an adenoma and fat containing RCC/HCC and liposarcoma*  

NCCT \<10HU = Adenoma (S/S = 74/96)  

Also, HISTOGRAM ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE   
    - Draw circle over 2/3 of the area.   
    - See if / proportion of pixels are \< 0HU   
    - 88% of lipid poor adenoma ( ie standard HU \>10HU ) have some negative HU pixels.   
    - 53% of adenomas on CECT have negative pixels vs 0% of mets.    
    - On NCCT \>= 5% negative pixels S/S = 92/100   

2) ENHANCEMENT CHARACTERISTICS   
*adenomas drain faster than mets*  

$$ 
Absolute Percent Washout=\frac{e-d}{e-u}x100
$$

> e = attenuation at 60s post iv contrast  
> d = attenuation at 15mins delay.   
> u = attenuation on non-contrast.   
Absolute 60% washout at 15% = 88/96 for adenoma. 

$$
Relative Percent Washout=\frac{e-d}{e}x100
$$
Relative >40% is 96/100 for adenoma!

**MR Imaging** 

Exploit presence of fat.

$$
Signal intensity index = \frac{SI in phase - SI out of phase}{SI in phase}x100 
$$

Adenomas tend to be > 5%, whilst mets tend to be <5%. 
Also compare to the change in signal from the spleen.
