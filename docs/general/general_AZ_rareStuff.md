### The Table
| Name | Clinical | Pathology | Radiology |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **AAAAAAA** |
| Alagille Syndrome<br>ALGS<br> | Muiltisystem but<br>**Hepatic** = Bile duct paucity.<br>**Cardiac** = Pulmonary stenosis & Tetralogy of Fallot<br>**MSK** = Butterfly vertebrae. Insuff #. Characteristic Facies<br>**Eye** = Posterior embryotoxin (80% vs 10% popln)<br>**Other** = Renal dysplasia inter alia. Vascular lesions. Growth failure. Mild LD. | JAG1 recessive. 96% penetrance <br> Also NOTCH2 mutation but rarer.<br> 1 in 30-50k births|| 


| Name | Clinical | Pathology | Radiology |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **BBBBBBBB** |  
| Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome<br>BGS| Multisystem, genetic with<br>**Growth** = Macroglossia(90%), macrosomia(50%) & Hemihypertrophy (50%). Organomegaly (Renal 40%,Hepatic 35%,Spleen 15%)<br>**Abdominal Wall** = Omphalocele(44%), Umbilical Hernia/Diastasis(40%)<br>**Embryonal Tumours** = Risk dependent on type of mutation.Wilms in first 7ys, hepatoblastoma in first 3ys. But also NBL, RMS and adrenocortical carcinoma.<br>**Endocrine** = Neonatal hypoglycaemia. Hypercalciuria.<br>**Renal** = Range inc Dysplasia, nephrocalcinosis, duplex, MSK ia.<br>Others = Several general uncommon. Ear pits/lob creases etc are common. | >80% identified looking for 5 alterations:<br>4 mutations: Loss of methylation at the IC2 on maternal chromosome(50%), Gain of methylation of IC1 on maternal chromosome, Paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) of 11p15.5 (=both copies come from Dad), Heterozygous pathogenic variant on maternal CDKN1C<br>or Genomic variants involving chromosome 11p15.5. | Risk of malignancy and thus need for screening is **limited** to specific phenotypes and varies between the type of tumour.<br>Biggest risk comes from Gain of methylation at IC1 maternal (= 29% risk of Ca) |
