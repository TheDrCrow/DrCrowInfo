Generally says conservative management (= do nothing for 6 months), is better for majority of cases.  
 - Healing rate of ~ 60%   
 - Majority of Classic Juvenile OCD ( = on the Medial femoral condyle) being stable. 88%.

Important to think this is in JUVENILE with vascularised cartilage and thus potential to heal and not in ADULTS who mostly need surgery and have increased risk of DJD.  
Healing of JOCD takes 6 to 18 months. So, is a big undertaking.  

## Technique  

Uses Radiographs and MRI in complimentary fashion 

### Radiographs [^Wall2015]  

Uses system developed by 7 Orthopods on 45 cases :side_eye, but says it is ok. 

**Based on Following Radiographic Descriptors:**

- PROGENY BONE FRAGMENT 
    - Mineralization: 
    - Fragmentation: 
    - Displacement: 
    - Centre & Rim Density: 
    - Contour:  
- BOUNDARY AT INTERFACE  
- PARENT BONE 
    - Peripheral Radiodensity:
