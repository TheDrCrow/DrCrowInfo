Question: Is the lump a lymph node(s)? 

---

### If the lump is a lymph node. 

Consider:   
 1. Palpable lymph nodes are normal. [^Alves_Rosa2021] [^Paddock2020]  
 2. Persistent normal nodes are normal in children. [^Meadows2020]  
 3. Lymph nodes varying in size is normal.  
 4. US is of limited utility in differentiating the different causes of lymphadenopathy.[^Paddock2020]  
 5. If there are features suggestive of a lymphoma then please refer as per [NICE NG12](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng12/chapter/recommendations-organised-by-symptom-and-findings-of-primary-care-investigations#symptoms-in-children-and-young-people)  
 6. If the concern is leukaemia or other malignancy then please refer as per [NICE NG12](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng12/chapter/recommendations-organised-by-symptom-and-findings-of-primary-care-investigations#symptoms-in-children-and-young-people).  

If still wanting to refer then just guide to a non-ordered input.

### If the lump is a not then a lymph node.

Use the usual non-ordered inputs.

## What is a Normal node in a child?[^Alves_Rosa2021]

![Normal Neck Nodes in Children](images/normal_neck_nodes.png)

Based on Cor T2 of 200 children having MR for other reasons, mostly headache.  
Largest nodes in each station were assessed *only on the coronal scans - thus not a proper SAD*. 

Results:   
 - 4% of population had measurable superficial cervical nodes. Mean SAD = 5mm, Max = 9mm.  
 - Even occipital nodes were mean SAD = 3 to 4mm.   
 - For most 'deep' nodal stations the **Mean SAD** was 10-12mm !! With the largest nodes being in 3-5y olds.
